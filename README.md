# PVF viz
Usingg three.js and Brainbrowser for brain visualisations for vector fields, singularities and streamlines

# BrainBrowser
BrainBrowser is a JavaScript library allowing for web-based, 2D and 3D visualization of neurological data. It consists of the Surface Viewer, a real-time 3D rendering tool for visualizing surface data, and the Volume Viewer, a slice-by-slice volumetric data analysis tool.

BrainBrowser uses open web-standard technologies such as HTML5, CSS, JavaScript and WebGL. The Surface Viewer uses three.js for 3D rendering.

Demonstrations of available functionality can be found at the BrainBrowser website.

# Freesurfer

To obtain obj format data from surf data output from Freesurfer, following command from Freesurfer can be used,

> mris_convert lh.pial lh.pial.obj
> mris_convert rh.pial rh.pial.obj

# To do list
@miao-cao Build structure for web page and core functions to load and visualise components.

@Christine-wxx try to add functions to render field potentials on cortical surfaces.


Key Components:

 - Visualise Pial surface with some transparency.
 - Plot vector fields with a time slider because vector fields is time dependent.
 - Plot streamlines on top of pial surfaces and vector fields. streamlines are also time dependent and should be color coded from start to end.
 - Plot singularities on top of pial surfaces and vector fields. singularities are also time dependent. Plot extend of singularities as well and also time dependent.
